    <tr><td width=33%><p><span>Set in a beautiful seaside town on the Italian Riviera, Disney and Pixar's original feature film "Luca" is a coming-of-age story about one young boy experiencing an unforgettable summer filled with gelato, pasta and endless scooter rides. Luca (voice of Jacob Tremblay) shares these adventures with his newfound best friend, Alberto (voice of Jack Dylan Grazer), but all the fun is threatened by a deeply-held secret: they are sea monsters from another world just below the water's surface.</span></p>

      <td width=33%><p>I pick movie Luca as one of my favorite movies is because the movie is about friendship and courage. We have both when we are young, but when we grow up, sometimes, we are so afraid to try something new and afraid of making mistakes. Luca and his friends tried hard for a competition that they knew they had very limited chance to win. They never gave up for the goal and they didn't let anyone left behind.  </p>
