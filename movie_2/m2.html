      <td><p>I like movie Kung Fu Panda is because it has a lot of humor as well as inspirations. Po the Panda is a Kung Fu newbie in the beginning. No one expected him to be the Kung Fu master and his dad just wanted him to take over the noodle restaurant. But Master Oogway saw his potentials and encourages Po to believe in himself that he will be a really Kung Fu master one day. When Po finally opens the dragon scroll to find a way to fight Tai lung, there’s no word in it but it’s only reflecting Po’s own face. Every one is the hero of his own journey, we can’t loose our faith and we need to fight to the end.</p>
